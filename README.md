# Microbiology Laboratory Database System 🧬

## Project Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a relational database system for a clinical microbiology laboratory. [cite_start]It is designed to optimize the management of patient records, biological samples, and analysis results while ensuring data integrity and enabling epidemiological tracking[cite: 98, 99, 101].

## Key Features
- [cite_start]**Relational Modeling:** Developed Conceptual (CDM) and Logical (LDM) data models to handle complex relationships between patients, samples, and pathogens.
- [cite_start]**Advanced Querying:** Complex SQL scripts for filtering patient data, tracking infection trends, and generating automated laboratory reports.
- [cite_start]**Data Integrity:** Strict constraints and foreign keys to ensure scientific accuracy and reliable medical records[cite: 101].

## Technologies Used
- **Database Engine:** MySQL
- **Language:** SQL (DDL, DML, DQL)# Microbiology-Lab-SQL-Database
